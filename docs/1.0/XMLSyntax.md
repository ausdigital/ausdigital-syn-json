# XML Syntax for UBL documents

The eInvoicing Semantic Model also makes no assumption about the Data Format, syntax or transmission technology used. However in the Council's eInvoice Interoperability Framework the model is applied to a specific Data Format (UBL) [(OASIS UBL Technical Committee, 2013)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/).

The normative form for UBL documents is XML and the normative definition is the UBL XSD Schema library.
