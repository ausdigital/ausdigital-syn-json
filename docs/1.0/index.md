## Introduction

This eInvoicing Semantic Model Specification:

 * Incorporates common Invoice requirements for commercial, technical, financial and regulatory (e.g. Tax) usage;
 * Aligns with the Australian Reporting Dictionary (through incorporation);
 * Exploits the ability to share the model and gain efficiencies of a standardised data model;
 * Identifies a common ‘Core’ model;
 * Consistent reuse of standardised definitions and meanings provide greater opportunities to optimise Business Processes and ability to integrate information with further cost reduction; and
 * Makes use of a proven methodology;
  
The eInvoicing Semantic Model has been defined and elaborated in a consultative manner – reusing existing international standards
